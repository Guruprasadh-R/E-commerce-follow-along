# E-Commerce Application (MERN Stack)  

Welcome to the E-Commerce Application project! This project is part of the **Follow Along Project: Milestone 1**, where we will learn to build a full-fledged e-commerce application from scratch using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to provide hands-on experience with real-world development concepts and tools. By the end of this project, you will have a functional e-commerce application with features like user authentication, product management, and order handling.  

## Learning Goals 
- Understand the overall structure of a MERN stack project.  
- Set up a new project repository and initialize it effectively.  
- Gain clarity on the functionalities of an e-commerce application.  
- Learn the foundational steps of backend development, database schema design, and REST API creation.  

## Key Features  
1. **MERN Stack:** A JavaScript-only approach for full-stack development.  
2. **REST API Creation:** Scalable endpoints for user authentication, product management, and order handling.  
3. **Authentication:** Secure login and registration functionalities.  
4. **Database Schema Design:** Structured data models using MongoDB.  
5. **Backend Development:** Robust server-side logic with Node.js and Express.  
6. **Frontend:** React for building a dynamic and user-friendly interface.  

## Milestone 1 Overview  
- **Introduction to the MERN Stack:** Understanding the technologies and how they work together.  
- **REST API Structure:** Building endpoints for essential features like user authentication, product management, and order handling.  
- **Database Schema Design:** Creating well-structured data models in MongoDB.  
- **Authentication:** Learning the role of authentication in web applications and implementing it.
