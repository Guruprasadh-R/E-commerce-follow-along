Designed the User Model with a schema defining user details (e.g., name, email, password).

Developed the User Controller to manage user data operations like adding or fetching users.

Integrated Multer to enable file uploads (e.g., profile pictures) and store them in the backend.

## Milestone 5:
In this milestone, we focused on developing the signup page to enable users to create an account within the application. Key achievements include: Signup Page Implementation: Developed the Signup.jsx component with a user-friendly interface for account registration. Included form fields for user details such as name, email, and password. Form Validation: Added client-side validation logic to ensure proper input formatting and error messages for invalid entries. Integration with Routing: Configured navigation to and from the signup page using React Router for seamless user flow. Styling: Enhanced the design of the signup page to align with the application's overall styling for a consistent user experience. Code Organization: Refactored the code into reusable components where possible to promote cleaner and more maintainable code. This milestone enhances the user experience by allowing new users to register, paving the way for further integration with back-end user authentication systems.

## Milestone 6:
In this milestone, we completed the following:

- Implemented advanced product filtering and search functionality.
- Optimized backend API endpoints for better performance.
- Integrated payment processing using Stripe.
- Enhanced user authentication with JWT expiration handling.

- Fixed bugs from previous milestones and improved error handling.


## Milestone 7:
Login Authentication S

User Enters Credentials: The user provides their email/username and password on the login page.
Fetch User Data from Database: The backend retrieves the user record based on the provided email/username. If the user is not found, return an error: "User does not exist."
Compare Encrypted Passwords: Process the user's input password using the same hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt). Compare the resulting hash to the stored hashed password. If they match, the user is authenticated; if not, send an error.
Create Login Endpoint: Accept user credentials (email/username and password). Retrieve the corresponding user from the database.
Validate Password: Use bcrypt to hash the entered password. Compare it with the stored hashed password for authentication.
Return Response: If authentication is successful, generate and return a session/token. If authentication fails, return an error message.


## Milestone 8:
Displays a list of products in a grid format.
Uses a Product component to render individual product cards with an image, name, description, and price.
