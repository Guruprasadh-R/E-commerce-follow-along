- Integrated payment processing using Stripe.
- Enhanced user authentication with JWT expiration handling.
- Improved UI/UX by refining product pages and checkout flows.
- Fixed bugs from previous milestones and improved error handling.


## Milestone 7:
Login Authentication S

User Enters Credentials: The user provides their email/username and password on the login page.
Fetch User Data from Database: The backend retrieves the user record based on the provided email/username. If the user is not found, return an error: "User does not exist."
Compare Encrypted Passwords: Process the user's input password using the same hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt). Compare the resulting hash to the stored hashed password. If they match, the user is authenticated; if not, send an error.
Create Login Endpoint: Accept user credentials (email/username and password). Retrieve the corresponding user from the database.
Validate Password: Use bcrypt to hash the entered password. Compare it with the stored hashed password for authentication.
Return Response: If authentication is successful, generate and return a session/token. If authentication fails, return an error message.


## Milestone 8:
Displays a list of products in a grid format.
Uses a Product component to render individual product cards with an image, name, description, and price.
The Home component maps over a predefined list of products and renders them using the Product component.
Styled using Tailwind CSS for responsiveness and modern UI design.

## Milestone 10 :
In this milestone, we focused on defining the structure of product data and creating an API endpoint to store product details in MongoDB.

Product Schema Definition: Defined a structured product schema using Mongoose to store product data in MongoDB. Ensured each field has proper validation to maintain data integrity: Name: Required, string Description: Required, string Price: Required, number, with validation for non-negative values Image URL(s): Required, array of strings for multiple image storage Category: Required, string CreatedAt: Automatically generated timestamp
Endpoint Creation: Developed a POST endpoint (/api/products) to accept product details from the frontend. Implemented validation to ensure only correctly formatted data is stored in the database. Saved product information to MongoDB using Mongoose models.
Data Validation & Integrity: Enforced strict validation to prevent invalid or incomplete product entries. Returned appropriate error messages for missing or incorrect data inputs.

## Milestone 11:
Fetching and Displaying Product Data
In this milestone, we focused on retrieving product data from the backend and dynamically displaying it in the frontend. Key achievements include:

Frontend: Fetching Data from API Created an API call function using fetch or axios in React to retrieve product data from the backend. Managed the fetched data using React useState and useEffect hooks to ensure dynamic updates.
Displaying Products Dynamically Passed the fetched product data to a ProductCard component. Used the product details (name, image, price, etc.) as props to display them dynamically. Applied responsive CSS styling to create a visually appealing product grid layout.


## Milestone 12:
 Filtering Products by User Email and Displaying Data
In this milestone, we focused on filtering products based on the user's email and sending only relevant product data to the frontend. Key achievements include:

Backend: Creating a Filtered API Endpoint Developed a GET endpoint (/api/products/:email) to return products associated with a specific user email. Used Mongoose to query the database and fetch only the products uploaded by the provided email. Implemented error handling to manage scenarios where no products match the email.
Frontend: Fetching Filtered Data from API Created a function in React to fetch only products uploaded by the logged-in user. Used Axios or Fetch API to make requests to the backend with the logged-in user's email. Managed product data using useState and useEffect hooks.
Displaying Filtered Products Dynamically Passed the fetched filtered product data to a ProductCard component. Rendered product details such as name, image, price, and description dynamically. Ensured a clean and structured UI using CSS and responsive layout techniques.

## Milestone 13:
In this milestone, we focused on implementing update functionality for product data, allowing users to modify existing product information through an editable form. Key achievements include:

Backend: Creating an Update Endpoint Developed a PUT endpoint to receive and update existing product data in MongoDB. Used Mongoose to find the product by its ID and update its fields. Ensured data validation to maintain data integrity and prevent errors during updates. Handled potential errors, such as cases where the product is not found. Frontend: Form Auto-Fill and Edit Functionality Added an Edit button to each product card. Clicking the Edit button opens a form pre-filled with the existing product details. Users can modify the form fields and save changes to update the product. Used React state and useEffect to manage form data and populate it with the productâ€™s current details. UI and UX Enhancements Ensured a responsive layout for the edit form, providing a user-friendly experience. Added error messages for invalid data and success notifications on successful updates. Future Enhancements & Experimentation Admin-Only Access: Restrict update functionality to authorized users, such as shop owners or admins.
